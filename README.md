🚀 Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulus
- Continuous calculation with previous result
- Graceful exit and input validation
- Modular design using functions

🧠 Concepts Practiced
- def functions and return values
- while loops and control flow
- Type conversion and error handling
- ASCII art and user experience enhancements

📂 Files
main.py
art.py


🛠️ How to Run
